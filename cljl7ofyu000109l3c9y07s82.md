# Introduction

* **This is a challenge containing four flags to teach you some common web vulnerabilities.**
    
* **Challenge difficulty: Easy**
    

## Recon( Information Gathering)

in this stage, you would like to use some tools like [Nmap](https://nmap.org/), [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/) and [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/)  
but this is an easy challenge so we go a little simple here

When I jump into a challenge I like to start by manually investigating what is possible within the constraints of the user interface. In this case, the challenge is a simple CMS with the following features:

1. View page
    
2. Edit page
    
3. Create page

I have the option to provide user input that might get reflected to another user I try to inject some HTML and Javascript. This prompted me to first try to create a page.

### Flag 0

Let's find it.  
I started by creating a new page, to learn the system, now edit that page, (Keep an eye on the IDs given)  let's view that page. let's change the id given (http://url/dynamic folder/page/Id) assuming you were assigned as like I was at ID 11, and change that to 10, let's walk it up from 10 to 1 and view all these pages.  
Note: One of these will show a Forbidden permission page. Remember that ID, for me it was ID 5.

Let's go back to your page, and edit your page it should show: ([http://url/dynamic](http://url/dynamic) folder/page/edit/10)  Now let's test the permissions of page 5? because remember this is an exploitation of security so let's break stuff shall we?  it should show  
(http://url/dynamic folder/page/edit/5)

Found the Flag!

### Flag 1

Let's add a character, this normally breaks stuff

View page 1  (http://url/dynamic folder/page/1)  
add ‘ to the end of the 1 (http://url/dynamic folder/page/1’) now this should break the page.

Now edit page 1. : (http://url/dynamic folder/page/edit/1)  
let's do it again add ‘ to the end of page 1.  
(http://url/dynamic folder/page/edit/1’)  
Instead of breaking, it dropped a flag!

Found the Flag!

### Flag 2

Ok, this is something I’ve heard about for a while cross-site scripting ([XSS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/)).  
Give a heads up check out this for more information.

Edit page 1, and add a script snippet, this needs to use the Alert XSS or I call it the Alert X-Ass… (http://url/dynamic folder/page/edit/1)  
add in the title and body &lt;script&gt; Alert ‘XSS'&lt;/script&gt;

Now save it and hit “Go Back”

Should error out and give you Flag 2 as it did for me!

Found the Flag!

### Flag 3

This is similar to Flag 3 but this one needs a bit of creativity,  
do you remember when I said to find the IDs and count down, you see that adorable kitty on page 2 just like I did? (http://url/dynamic folder/page/2)

Let's edit this one!  Since we have done ID 5 let's go for ID 2 this time  
(http://url/dynamic folder/page/edit/2)

Add in this command &lt;button onclick=alert(1)&gt;  Kitty Button, CLICK ME!!!! &lt;/button&gt;  
then hit save.  
Opss! it just shows me an alert like flag 2 but there is no flag in the alert this time.  
Now check your dev tools (hint: F12), in the dev tools you will see the last flag^

Found the Flag!

### Conclusion

This challenge is a great introduction to common CTF themes. I particularly liked that the `GET /page/5` endpoint was protected, but `/page/edit/5` wasn’t since this is a common issue even in enterprise-level systems when they are not following secure by-default practices.
